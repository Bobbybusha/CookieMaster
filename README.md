Releases
-----------

I try to update CookieMaster as often as possible, but I'm currently a single developer doing this in my spare time, so there's no fixed release schedule as such.

For a full release history, consult the [changelog page](https://github.com/greenc/CookieMaster/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)


Browser Support
----------

Extensive browser testing has not yet been carried out, however CookieMaster should work happily in current releases of the following browsers:

 - Chrome (recommended)
 - Firefox
 - Safari
 - Internet Explorer 10+

CookieMaster uses some new web features that may not be supported in older browsers.


Developers / Contributing
----------

CookieMaster uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for building and managing the project. Although not necessary for contributing changes, it is recommended to have these installed if you want to take advantage of the project build tasks.

It is recommended to download and run Cookie Clicker locally for testing any changes you make to the plugin. All Cookie Clicker game assets are static, so just run a `wget` or your preferred equivalent on http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/ to grab the game files. The CookieMaster source file paths assume that you have Cookie Clicker running in an adjacent directory named `/cookieclicker`.

1. Make sure you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and optionally [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed first.
2. Fork the CookieMaster repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.
3. Make your changes. All source files are located in the `src/` folder. If you are using Node/Grunt, you can run `grunt build` to create a `build/` directory with optimized files for local testing (remember to **only** include `src/` files in your commits if you issue a pull request).
4. When you're done making changes, commit and push them up to your forked repository.
5. You may then create a pull request from GitHub if you would like to have your changes considered for inclusion in the main CookieMaster repo.
